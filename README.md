1. Next Code Camp challlenge is a personal portfolio website. Should be easy and look forward to linking to other sites I have built on Github.
2. Finished the main layout and navbar today. Need to touch some things up tomorrow. 
3. Added links, spacing, and cards. Had a problem using a background image with opacity near the fixed navbar. Checked stackoverflow and google but could not find a solution to that problem, so went with smoke background instead. Almost done with contact me section and full site. 
4. Finished contact section and site is good enough to submit. However, I'm going to work on the color scheme and design a bit more before moving on.
